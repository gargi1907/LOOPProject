# COMPILED VS INTERPRETED LANGUAGES ANALYSIS



## Compiled Languages

Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage.

Compiled languages need a “build” step - they need to be manually compiled first. You need to “rebuild” the program every time you need to make a change.

Examples of pure compiled languages are C, C++, Erlang, Haskell, Rust, and Go.

##  Interpreted Languages

Interpreters will run through a program line by line and execute each command.

Interpreted languages were once known to be significantly slower than compiled languages. But, with the development of just-in-time compilation, that gap is shrinking.

Examples of common interpreted languages are Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.

##  Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages of Compiled Languages

Programs compiled into native code at compile time usually tend to be faster than those translated at run time, due to the overhead of the translation process.

### Disadvantages of Compiled Languages
The most notable disadvantages are :-
-   Additional time needed to complete the entire compilation step before testing, and
-   Platform dependence of the generated binary code.
